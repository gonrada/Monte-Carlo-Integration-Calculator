    PROGRAM: Monte Carlo Integration Calculator
    AUTHOR: Sean Easton
    COURSE INFORMATION: CIS5930 - Summer '11
    Due Date: <give date project is due>

    SUMMARY
        A brief description of what the program does. Usually one paragraph in length.

    INPUT
        Here describe the input format. Is it interactive or from a data file? If from a file,
        what is the format of each line? How many data lines can be processed? Etc.

        BAD DATA CHECKING:
            If your program checks for data validity, describe here what is checked for and
            how errors are handled.
    OUTPUT
        Here describe the output values and their format. If tables or other complex output is produced,
        show an example.
    DATA STRUCTURES
        If any major data structures are used (arrays, strings, structures, classes, linked lists, etc.)
        briefly describe them here and their role in the program.

    ASSUMPTIONS
        If any important assumptions are made, state them here.
        These could include assumptions described in the project writeup,
        as well as assumptions you decide to make.
